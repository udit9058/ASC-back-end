            AICTE approved courses in the field of engineering and technology,management,pharmacy,
            architecture etc are affiliated to different universities and are conducted as per the syllabus prescribed by
             these universities.there are more than 100 such universities in the country afiliating the same course(s).
            however,the structure of the course,content and scheme of the course differs widely from university to university.
            resulting in varition in the academic standard of the same degree approved by AICTE at the time of admission 
            of higher studies and employment in india and abroad.</p>

                Therefore there is a need to develop an application to map stucture,content 
                and scheme of the course at present run by affiliated universities and map important features and 
                compare with a standard cirriculum of the highest standard .this would help AICTE to devlop and

        <p class="sectionSubtag1">
            Wide difference between the course structure from University to University, therefore, creating variation in academic standards of same degree approved by AICTE
            Due to the same reason stated above, each and every individual student is not getting access to to same level of knowledge and resourses within the country and on international basis as well.
            Todays curriculum has lack of skill development.
            It fails to focus on Research and Practical portions which is very important for getting real workspace exposures and experiences.
